## Description

The package is designed to perform calculations related to the planning and analysis of the results of clinical trials. The package includes the basic functions described below, as well as a few modules to perform specific calculations.

## Installation
```
using Pkg; Pkg.add("ClinicalTrialUtilities");
```

## Note

**NB! Hypothesis types:**

When ctpower/ctsamplen used:

- :ea - Equality: two-sided hypothesis;
- :ei - Equivalencens: two one-sided hypothesis;
- :ns - Non-Inferiority / Superiority: one-sided hypothesis, for some cases you should use two-sided hypothesis for  Non-Inferiority/Superiority, you can use alpha/2 for this;

## Invalidated version v0.3.0 (removed from release page)

  Wrong Equivalence Hypothesis alpha level! Use 0.2.7, 0.3.1 version or higher.
